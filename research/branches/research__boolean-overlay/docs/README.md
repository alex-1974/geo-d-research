# geo-d technical documentation

This directory contains the architectural and numerical documentation for
`geo-d`.

The repository `README.md` provides the public introduction and usage
overview. `ROADMAP.md` tracks release preparation and possible future work.
This document describes the current technical model in more detail.

## Documentation map

Architecture decisions are recorded under:

~~~text
docs/adr/
~~~

The ADRs define stable semantic contracts for:

- library scope and boundaries;
- scalar and core geometry types;
- ownership and non-owning views;
- numerical robustness;
- segment intersection;
- ring and polygon representation;
- area semantics;
- point-in-polygon classification;
- topology validation;
- polyline simplification;
- polygon-union exact-overlay and result semantics in
  `ADR-0023-polygon-union-exact-overlay-and-result-contract.md`.

ADR status is authoritative. ADR-0023 is Accepted and defines the semantic,
numerical, ownership, allocation, and failure contract implemented by the
public polygon-union API.

Performance-specific material is documented under:

~~~text
benchmarks/
~~~

Public API documentation conventions are defined in:

~~~text
docs/ddoc-style.md
~~~

This guide defines the documentation contract for symbols exposed through
`import geo;`, including semantics, input domains, failure behaviour,
allocation, complexity, numerical guarantees, and examples.

Practical installation and task-oriented usage examples are collected in:

~~~text
docs/getting-started.md
~~~

The current v2 API-family conventions and migration audit are recorded in:

~~~text
docs/v2-api-conventions.md
docs/v2-public-api-audit.md
~~~

Canonical current documentation uses the dimension-explicit v2 names.
Deprecated v1 names are documented only where compatibility or migration
behaviour is the subject.



## Core geometry model

The foundational value types are:

~~~text
Point2
Vector2
Bounds2
Segment2
~~~

Supported core scalar types are:

~~~text
int
long
float
double
real
~~~

`Point2` represents an affine point and `Vector2` represents displacement.
They deliberately have different algebra.

Geometry values with different scalar types do not implicitly convert.

Explicit conversion is provided through checked conversion helpers and
explicit floating-point quantisation operations.

`Bounds2.init` is empty rather than a degenerate bounds at the origin.

## Variable-size geometry

Variable-size geometry is represented initially through non-owning,
read-only views:

~~~text
Polyline2View
LinearRing2View
Polygon2View
~~~

The caller owns the backing storage.

The views do not copy point data and are designed around explicit borrowing
and DIP1000 lifetime checking.

`Polygon2View` is a view over `LinearRing2View` descriptors. Its rings need not
share one contiguous point-storage region.

Ring roles are structural:

~~~text
ring 0      exterior
ring 1..n   holes
~~~

Winding direction does not assign polygon ring roles.

## Metric operations

The metric computation type is exposed as `MetricScalar!T`:

~~~text
int     -> double
long    -> double
float   -> double
double  -> double
real    -> real
~~~

Public metric operations include:

- `distance`;
- `squaredDistance`;
- `segmentLength`;
- `polylineLength`;
- `tryNearestPoint`;
- `tryPointSegmentDistance`.

Metric calculations are deliberately separate from topology predicates.

## Numerical robustness

`geo-d` does not use one global epsilon for computational topology.

Ordinary value algebra follows the normal arithmetic behaviour of the
corresponding D scalar type.

Topology-sensitive algorithms instead use exact or certified arithmetic
where their semantic contract requires it.

Robust topology support currently covers:

~~~text
int
long
float
double
~~~

A platform-aware robust backend for `real` is deliberately deferred.

Representability and algorithm validity are distinct concepts. Floating
`Point2`, `Vector2`, and `Segment2` values may contain non-finite values even
though a particular topology algorithm may reject them.

## Robust orientation

`orientation(a, b, c)` returns one of:

~~~text
Orientation2.right
Orientation2.collinear
Orientation2.left
~~~

The numerical strategies are:

| Scalar | Strategy |
|---|---|
| `int` | exact over the complete `int` domain |
| `long` | exact over the complete `long` domain |
| `float` | exact promotion into the binary64 robust backend |
| `double` | certified binary64 filter with exact fallbacks |
| `real` | deferred |

For `double`, increasingly expensive internal stages are used only when
necessary:

~~~text
certified binary64 filter
        |
        v uncertain
exact floating-point expansion
        |
        v unsupported exponent range
exact fixed-width dyadic fallback
~~~

The exact arithmetic implementation is internal and is not itself part of
the public API contract.

Verification includes an independent `std.bigint.BigInt` oracle in unittest
builds.

## Segment intersection

Segment intersection deliberately separates topology from geometric
construction.

Public operations are:

~~~text
segmentIntersectionKind
trySegmentIntersectionOverlap
trySegmentIntersectionPoint
~~~

`segmentIntersectionKind` is the authoritative topological classification.

Positive-length overlap construction selects exact endpoints from the input
geometry.

Unique intersection-point construction treats endpoint contacts and
T-junctions separately from proper crossings.

Proper crossings are constructed through exact bounded arithmetic and
rounded only when the final binary64 point coordinates are produced.

Conceptually:

~~~text
exact orient2d determinants
        |
        v
exact barycentric weights
        |
        v
exact weighted rational coordinates
        |
        v
round-to-nearest, ties-to-even
        |
        v
Point2!double
~~~

A rounded construction result must not be substituted for exact topology
classification.

## Signed area

Linear-ring signed area is based on exact determinant accumulation for the
supported non-`real` scalar domains.

The accumulated exact result is converted to binary64 only once.

This avoids repeated floating-point rounding during vertex accumulation.

Signed area remains algebraic. Ring orientation determines the sign but does
not by itself determine polygon role.

Self-intersecting rings therefore retain algebraic cancellation semantics;
validity is handled separately by topology validation.

## Polygon area

Polygon area uses structural ring roles rather than winding direction.

Conceptually:

~~~text
abs(exterior exact area)
    - sum(abs(hole exact area))
~~~

Ring contributions are combined before the final rounding step.

Area calculation does not implicitly:

- validate topology;
- normalise winding;
- repair rings;
- reinterpret ring roles.

## Point-in-polygon classification

Point classification uses explicit three-way semantics:

~~~text
outside
boundary
inside
~~~

Boundary detection is exact for the supported robust scalar domains.

Interior classification uses even-odd semantics and does not depend on ring
orientation.

Polygon classification treats a point as inside when it is inside the
exterior ring and not inside a hole, subject to explicit boundary handling.

Representation and classification remain separate from topology validation.

## Topology validation

Validation is explicit rather than embedded into geometry construction.

Public entry points are:

~~~text
validateRing
validatePolygon
~~~

Ring validation detects conditions including:

- insufficient cardinality;
- non-finite coordinates;
- zero-length edges;
- self-intersections;
- self-overlaps.

Polygon validation additionally examines relationships between rings,
including:

- crossings;
- overlaps;
- distinct contact points;
- hole containment;
- nested holes;
- connected polygon interior.

Tangential contacts are permitted when the resulting topology satisfies the
polygon validity contract.

`validateRing` is designed for:

~~~text
pure
nothrow
@safe
@nogc
~~~

`validatePolygon` requires variable-size temporary bookkeeping for its
connected-interior analysis and therefore does not promise `@nogc`.

## Polygon union

`polygonUnion(first, second)` constructs the regularized two-dimensional
union of two valid polygons.

The supported robust input scalar domain is:

~~~text
int
long
float
double
~~~

Constructed coordinates follow `IntersectionScalar!T` and are currently
`double` for every supported input scalar. Exact arrangement topology remains
authoritative until the selected result boundary is materialized.

The operation returns an explicit `PolygonUnionResult`:

- the result owns immutable GC-backed point/ring/component storage;
- ordinary result copies are shallow descriptor copies rather than deep
  geometry copies;
- successful component access returns read-only `Polygon2View!double`
  descriptors;
- a successful result may contain zero, one, or multiple polygon components;
- components that meet only at an isolated point remain separate when their
  two-dimensional interiors are disconnected.

`PolygonUnionStatus` distinguishes:

~~~text
notComputed
success
invalidFirstInput
invalidSecondInput
unrepresentableConstruction
~~~

`PolygonUnionResult.init` is deliberately `notComputed`; it is distinct from
a successful empty union. Invalid polygons are reported rather than repaired.
If exact union topology cannot be represented faithfully in binary64, the
operation reports `unrepresentableConstruction` and exposes no partial
geometry.

Polygon union allocates variable-size exact-overlay workspace and immutable
result storage and therefore does not promise `@nogc`. Runtime allocation or
resource exhaustion is not a geometry status.

The current P1 implementation is the correctness-first semantic baseline.
Pairwise candidate discovery and quadratic post-materialization verification
can make its worst-case time O(n^4) in the total input boundary-edge count.
That bound is a baseline implementation characteristic, not a commitment for
future accelerated implementations.

## Douglas-Peucker simplification

Plain metric Douglas-Peucker simplification is provided for `Polyline2View`.

Public operations are:

~~~text
douglasPeuckerWorkspaceSize
trySimplifyDouglasPeuckerInto
~~~

The implementation:

- is iterative;
- does not recurse;
- performs no allocation;
- uses caller-provided destination storage;
- uses caller-provided workspace;
- returns an ordered subsequence of input points;
- retains first and last points for ordinary multi-point input;
- uses deterministic tie-breaking.

It deliberately does not claim topology preservation.

Ring and polygon simplification require a separate future design because
they must preserve constraints such as closure, self-intersection rules,
hole containment, and inter-ring relationships.

## Geometry bounds

Axis-aligned bounds of existing geometry are computed with:

~~~text
tryBounds
~~~

The operation supports:

~~~text
Segment2
Polyline2View
LinearRing2View
Polygon2View
~~~

Its semantics are representation-based rather than topology-validating.

For variable-size geometry:

- empty geometry succeeds with `Bounds2.init`;
- every stored coordinate contributes;
- polygon rings are all considered regardless of topology validity;
- NaN causes transactional failure;
- infinities are permitted;
- no allocation is performed.

Complexity is:

~~~text
Segment2        O(1)
Polyline2View    O(n)
LinearRing2View  O(n)
Polygon2View     O(total stored vertices)
~~~

The traversal cost is intentionally exposed through the `tryBounds` operation
rather than hidden behind a property access.

## Execution properties

Low-level numerical operations are designed to provide the strongest useful
contracts permitted by their semantics, commonly:

~~~text
pure
nothrow
@safe
@nogc
~~~

These attributes are API guarantees where declared, not merely stylistic
goals.

Higher-level algorithms may relax `@nogc` when variable-size temporary state
is inherently useful and explicit.

## Verification

Numerical and topology verification includes, where applicable:

- full-range signed integer coordinates;
- arbitrary finite binary32 and binary64 bit patterns;
- subnormal values;
- maximum finite binary64 values;
- exact collinearity;
- near-degenerate configurations;
- permutation invariants;
- endpoint-reversal invariants;
- independent `BigInt` oracle comparison;
- DMD and LDC execution.

Benchmarks are maintained for numerical paths where exact arithmetic may
materially affect runtime cost.

## Numerical follow-up

### Robust `real` topology

Supporting topology-sensitive operations for `real` remains deliberately
deferred. A robust implementation must not assume a particular representation,
precision, size, or alignment for D `real`.

This deferred feature is not a `v1.0.0` release blocker because the supported
robust topology scalar domain is explicitly documented as `int`, `long`,
`float`, and `double`.

### Polyline-length accumulation

The polyline-length accumulation review required for the v1 series is
complete.

`polylineLength` uses compensated accumulation while preserving its existing
public result type and execution contracts. The design decision is recorded in
ADR-0017.

## Design rule

Numerical construction, robust topology, geometry representation, validation,
and ownership are separate concerns in `geo-d`.

Keeping these concerns separate is intentional. It prevents convenience
APIs from silently weakening topology guarantees, introducing hidden
allocation, or changing geometry semantics.

## Generated API documentation
